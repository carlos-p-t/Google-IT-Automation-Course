# Google-IT-Automation-Course

The [Google IT Automation Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation) is a series of courses which aim to provide tools to perform automation into daily tasks. This repository contains the last and most important projects given during the courses. A brief description of them is shown below.

## Mini-Project 1

The [first mini-project](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Google-IT-Automation-Course/tree/main/Mini%20Project%201) focuses on practicing fundamental skills of image manipulation through Python. For that, it is necessary to interact with the OS for retrieving data, open files, modifying them, and saving the results.

## Mini-Project 2

The [second mini-project](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Google-IT-Automation-Course/tree/main/Mini%20Project%202) aims to provide experience with interacting with the OS to retrieve data from files, process such information, transform it into a web manageable format, and upload the information to a running web service.

## Mini-Project 3

Through the [third mini-project](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Google-IT-Automation-Course/tree/main/Mini%20Project%203), some more automation practices were covered. For this project, data had to be processed and summarized, then, a PDF report had to be generated automatically, and finally, the generated file had to be sent by email automatically as well.

## Final Project

The [final project](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Google-IT-Automation-Course/tree/main/Final%20Project) introduces a complete real-world problem where it is needed to combine the previous knowledge to solve it sucessfully.
