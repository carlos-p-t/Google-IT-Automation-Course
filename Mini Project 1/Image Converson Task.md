# Scaling and Converting Images using PIL

*From Coursera Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate, Course 6, [Module 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automating-real-world-tasks-python/ungradedLti/J7VqG/qwiklabs-assessment-scale-and-convert-images-using-pil).*

## Introduction

This first mini-project is based on the scenario below. The goal is to get familiar using Python PIL library and manipulate images.

Scenario: *Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they've hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90° and too large. You're not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You'll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.*

The images received are in the wrong format:

- .tiff format
- Image resolution 192x192 pixel (too large)
- Rotated 90° anti-clockwise

The images required for the launch should be in this format:

- .jpeg format
- Image resolution 128x128 pixel
- Should be straight

## Tasks

Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:

* Open an image
* Rotate an image
* Resize an image
* Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory

## Results

The [code](https://github.com/carlos-p-t/Google-IT-Automation-Course/blob/main/Mini%20Project%201/image_conversion.py) shows the implementation of what was required. All images were succesfully modified upon request. The output was verified after getting information of resulting images, an example can be seen in the image below.
